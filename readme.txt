The task was to deliver a system that could test a specically made fabric sensor. The fabric sensor was specially designed in a
way whereby the application of pressure would induce an impedence change. An AC voltage drop accoss the fabric was required in 
order to view the impedence change- the frequency of which would need to be set to approx 10 hz. 

The voltage readings would then be passed to an ESP8266 Huzzah board's ADC pin. The values would then be sent (using wifi) to 
a web application hosted on an adafruit server.
